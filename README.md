# Productive
This makes people producktive. 

1. the app will ask for a time duration of the task and its due date
2. then it will distribute the task into each day 
3. you can put if you're busy on some days so that the app won't put hours for the task on that day
4. if you don't complete a task on a day its assigned, you can put an X on that day or something and the app will redistribute the hours
5. maybe the app could motivate you by having levels and awards but seems complicated and there's already Habitica for that
